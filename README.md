=== Mario & Luigi: Dream Team SAVE FILE PACKAGE ===


== Read Me ==

This save file package was created by Snodeca and Migu. This package consists of multiple folders in which you can find a multitude of save files. There are save files for each route of each category that we know of and more.


== HOW TO LOAD A SAVE FILE ==

On a Nintendo 3DS, you must have a hacked 3DS. Once you have an adapater created, get a save game tool (such as JKSV or Checkpoint) and copy your current save file to the SD Card. Insert the SD Card in the 3DS and locate the save file. In the folder with the save file, you will find three files with the names ML__00x. Keep this folder as a backup to your old save files unless you don't need them anymore.

In the list of save game folders (not in the folder with the ML__00x save files but the folder before that!), create a new folder and name it whatever. Find whatever save file you need from this GitHub, click it and then at the bottom of the page click "View raw". This will download the file. Name it "ML4__001.sav" or "ML4__002.sav", depending on whether you want it to be the first file. Make sure to download a second file.

Also download ML4__000.sav on the front page of this GitHub. Put this together with the other ML4__00x.sav files.

ALTERNATIVELY:

You can download the zip file at the top of each list of save games, extract that to wherever your save file folder is and just use that. This is simpler but gives you less freedom with what save files you want from different points of the game.
